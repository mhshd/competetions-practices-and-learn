A repo to share my developing abilities and my ways to solve problems
I've participated in coding marathons for 2 or 3 years. 
I thought it would be nice if I share my codes. In this way, I have a repo to discuss my abilities and weaknesses with my developer colleagues.
Questions are defined in Persian and English. I try to refer to the site that made the contests. Questions have different difficulties level.
There is no limitation in using language to solve the problem, Therefore, I try to work with every technology that I've learned these years.
I will categorize the technologies.
